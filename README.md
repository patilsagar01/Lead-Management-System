 <h1 align="center">Lead-Management-System</h1>
 
> This is the Lead Management System website by Sagar Patil

This is the Admin-page which is help to the website owner to collect all lead data from the entire website
 
   This project was created during my internship by me and my team member kalpesh nikam. In that project we will get all the lead's information on Admin pannel 
Infrmation like **Email-ID,Contact Number,Address,Age and Country with country Code** and in that project we also use MS-SQL server for store all the data 
in back-end and we use c# for making the connections beetween SQL server and Admin-Pannel.
   In that project we also provide bulk Email sending facility to Admin in that we can choose 1 or more Email ID's and write our Email and send them all selected ID's.
And we also add charts to display all records for Admin and Admin can add 1 or more users for admin pannel.



# **IF YOU CAN USE THIS PROJECT THEN YOU NEED TO INSTALL MS-SQL SERVER ALSO**
